                            "content": "(1) Daniel Andersen, a famous psychologist, believes that it’s important to distinguish television’s influences on children from those of the family. We tend to blame TV, he says, for problems it doesn’t really cause, overlooking our roles in shaping children’s minds.\n\n(2) One traditional belief about television is that it reduces a child’s ability to think and understand the world. While watching TV, children do not merely absorb words and images. Instead, they learn both explicit and hidden meanings from what they see. Actually, children learn the psychology of characters in TV shows earlier. Furthermore, as many teachers agree, children understand far more when their parents watch TV with them, explaining new words and ideas. Yet, most parents use an educational program as a chance to park their kids in front of the set and do something else in another room.\n\n(3) Another argument against television is that it replaces reading as a form of entertainment. But according to Anderson, the amount of time spent watching television is not related to the children’s reading ability. TV doesn’t take the place of reading for most children; it takes the place of similar sorts of recreation, such as listening to the radio and playing sports. Things like parents’ educational background have a stronger influence on a child’s reading. “A child’s reading ability is best predicted by how much a parent reads,” Anderson says.\n\n(4) According to traditional wisdom, heavy television watching affects children’s IQ scores and even their school performance. However, Anderson notes that no studies have proved it. In fact, research suggests that it’s the other way around. “If you are smart, you will watch less TV when you are older,” Andersen says. Yet, people with a lower IQ tend to be lifelong television viewers.\n\n(5) For years, researchers have attempted to show that television is dangerous to children. However, the studies have not shown the dangerous effects of television as conventionally believed yet. Anderson suggests that television cannot be condemned without considering other influences.",
