                "content": "(1) High traffic levels remain a problem for many governments. Car ownership in fast-developing countries continues to double each year, and migration to cities is also rising quickly, resulting in high levels of congestion and pollution.\n(2) Until recently, governments successfully controlled traffic levels by imposing financial obligations on drivers. They made it more expensive to drive by raising taxes on petrol or increasing parking costs, while making public transport cheaper by investing in rail and bus travel. However, these ‘tax and spend’ approaches are no longer possible to introduce easily. This is because living costs are growing in many countries, so governments can’t spend as much money and people are angry when they have to pay more. New controls are, therefore, needed.\n(3) Legal solutions to congestion issues are now attracting greater interest. However, traffic laws and regulations have often proved ineffective. For example, banning cars in city centres has simply transferred problems to the edge of cities. Similarly, controlling speed limits has been effective on fast roads but has done little to solve congestion in urban areas.\n(4) A more effective legal intervention might be to stop some people from driving altogether – but who exactly? If workers were stopped from driving, they might not be able to get to work. Many older citizens and families also rely on cars to move around easily. Furthermore, both these groups vote frequently, so it would be a political disaster to prevent them from driving.\n(5) This leaves young people. Many people would agree with raising the minimum driving age in order to reduce the number of drivers on the road and cut pollution. Young people make up over 25% of road deaths in many countries and, according to recent research, parts of the brain that help to calculate risks and consequences are not fully developed until the age of 25. Consequently, there have already been discussions in the media about stopping young people driving or carrying passengers.\n(6) Of course, young people would have to be given financial assistance to make sure public transport remained affordable for them. But as pressure grows on the governments to reduce congestion, it surely makes sense to postpone the time that young drivers get their licenses until a little later in life.",
