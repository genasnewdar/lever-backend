            "content": "(1) Why do some achieve more than others? Ask a successful person and they may point to their talents and hard work. Investor Warren Buffet, for instance, suggests that integrity, intelligence, and energy are essential, whereas for millionaire Marc Andreessen it’s about motivation, drive, ethics, and curiosity. In short, what’s on the inside is key. Research suggests that what’s on the outside counts more than we think.\n(2) Person’s intelligence and family background have much less impact after leaving university. Recent research into legal careers shows that while students from well-educated families tend to enter the profession more easily, the less advantaged students that enter usually earn more and work for better firms. Some causes of success clearly lie beyond academic achievement.\n(3) Admittedly, the capacity for hard work is probably important, too. A recent study found that people who earn less than $20,000 a year spent more than a third of their time in passive leisure. By contrast, those earning more than $100,000 a year spent less than a fifth of their time relaxing.\n(4) Indeed, new research suggests that a wide variety of external factors also assist high achievers. Rice University, in Texas, found that a person’s looks and smile particularly help them to gain trust and so bring employment or promotion opportunities. A person’s height and the depth of their voice are also significant, it would seem. Male Chief Executive Officers (CEO) are over 7 centimetres taller than the average man, according to Harvard University, and those with lower-pitched voices apparently have better social connection than other CEOs.\n(5) Self-presentation and the dressing way also play a role. For example, a typical pink shirt wearer earns $1,000 more per year than males who wear more sober colours for work. Another study showed that women who wear make-up are far more likely to be taken seriously than those who don’t, demonstrating that appearance itself bring rewards.\n(6) So, is style becoming more important than substance? Given the importance of the visual image in the modern media, it would not be surprising. Perhaps, teaching the art of making an impression on others may be as valuable to today’s generation as a traditional schooling.",
