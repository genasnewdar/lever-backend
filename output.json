But when John reached adulthood, he was better than his childhood playmates. He had more job satisfaction, a better marriage, and was healthier. Most of all, he was happier. Far happier.\n\n(2) The findings of a 40-year study that observed the lives of 456 teenage boys from Boston showed that those who had worked during their boyhood enjoyed happier and more productive lives than those who had not. \"Boys who worked in the home or community gained more competence and came to feel ts worthwhile members of society\", said George Vaillant, the psychologist who made the discovery. As he also said, \"Because they felt good about themselves, others felt good about them as well.\"\n\n(3) Vaillant's study observed these males in great detail. Interviews were repeated at the ages of 25,31 and 47. Under Vaillant's supervision, the researchers compared the men's mental health scores with their boyhood-activity scores. Points were awarded for their part-time jobs, housework, school efforts, and ability to deal with problems.\n\n(4) The link between the scores of men's boyhood and adulthood activities was surprisingly sharp. Those who had done the most boyhood activities were twice as likely to have warm relations with a wide variety of people, five times as likely to be well paid, and 16 times less likely to have been unemployed. The researchers also found that IQ, family, a social and economic status made no real difference in how the boys turned out to be adults.\n\n(5) Working at any age is important. Childhood activities help children develop their abilities to be responsible, independent, confident and competent—the underpinnings of emotional health. They also help them understand the importance of cooperative work toward common goals. The most confident adults are those who know how to do this. Yet work isn't everything. As Tolstoy once said, \"On,e can live magnificently in this world if he/she knows how to work and love, and how to work for the person one loves and love one's work.\"",
